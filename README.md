# surface-level

a half-day project using node, sass, and some basic js to recreate a pico-8 scene.
used primarily as an excercise to learn a little sass, refamiliarize myself with keyframes, and just do something kind of creative.

The original design of this building was done as part of a Game Jam, for a game called Surface Level. I coded the game mechanics, but my friend Javi made the building art. This was attempt to recreate that art using mostly all css. I opted for javascript to make certain things a little easier, like div generation and positional randomness with the flying birds.
